                <h2>About Addis Safe House</h2>
                <p>Addis Safe House (ASH) is an international charity situated in the capital of  Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. As common in most countries the capital hosts the majority of the population accommodating just over 50% of the countries population.  This has lead to immense levels of competition for jobs especially with the constantly improving levels of education and international investment the demand for skilled labour has resulted in many young women feeling that prostitution and other sex work is there only way to survive. At ASH we use contemporary and innovative methods to help young women liberate themselves and develop new skill. </p>

                        <p>By providing shelter for these women we enable them to get rid of one of the main expense they have to lessen the financial burden they have to bare. By providing basic housing facilities we also enable these young women to not have to be out at night where often they are not safe and well equip to fight the temptation for quick money.

                        <p>In most cases these young girls are not simply partaking in prostitution and sex work for solely financial purposes even though it may play a major role. Majority of these girls have a story of abandonment, drug abuse, depression and many more factors. It is essential that we are able to provide some sort of counselling and mental support to help improve the mental state and general well being of these young girls who have probably witnessed more than they should have at such a young age.</p>
